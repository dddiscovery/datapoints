## GitHub Repo 

The Datapoints blog is built on GitHub, providing a collaborative platform for our team to create and share data science insights. This guide will walk you through our repository structure, development workflow, and help you set up your local environment for contributing to the blog.

Whether you're writing your first post or maintaining existing content, understanding our GitHub workflow will help ensure a smooth contribution process. Let's get started!

### Project Structure

```
DDDI_DP_Blog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _layouts/           # Universal HTML layouts for the blog
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _posts/            # Blog post content in Markdown
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/            # Static assets
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/          # Universal CSS files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/       # Global images
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post_assets/  # Post-specific assets
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName/  # Matches .md filename

```

#### Directory Details

##### `_layouts/`

Contains universal HTML layouts used across the blog. These templates define the structure and appearance of different page types.

##### `_posts/`

Stores all blog post content in Markdown format. 
- Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName.md`
- Example: `2025-01-27-Yuxin-Liang.md`

##### `assets/`

Static assets organized in three main categories:
- `css/`: Universal CSS files applied across the site
- `images/`: Global images used throughout the blog
- `post_assets/`: Post-specific assets
  - Each post should have its own directory matching the .md filename
  - Example: If your post is `2025-01-27-Yuxin-Liang.md`, create `assets/post_assets/2025-01-27-Yuxin-Liang/`
  - Store all post-specific settings, images, and other assets in this folder

### Working with Branches

#### Branch Structure
- `main`: Production-ready code, final destination for completed posts
- `firstname-lastname-staging`: Personal development branch for each author

#### Workflow
1. **Create Your Branch**

   ```bash
   # Create and switch to your personal staging branch
   git checkout -b yuxin-liang-staging
   ```

2. **Development Process**

   - Make all your changes in your personal staging branch
   - Test locally using Jekyll server
   - Commit changes frequently with clear messages

3. **Push to Your Branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin yuxin-liang-staging
   ```

4. **Final Review**

   - Ensure all content is complete
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Verify formatting across devices

5. **Merge to Main**

   - Only merge to `main` when post is complete
   - Create pull request from your branch to `main`
   - Request review if needed

### Setting Up Local Environment

#### Prerequisites
1. **Install Ruby**
   - For Windows:
     - Download and install Ruby from [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
     - Verify installation: `ruby -v`
   - For macOS:
     - Ruby comes pre-installed, but it's recommended to use a version manager
     - Install Homebrew if not already installed:
       ```bash
       /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
       ```
     - Install rbenv:
       ```bash
       brew install rbenv
       rbenv init
       ```
     - Install Ruby:
       ```bash
       rbenv install 3.2.0
       rbenv global 3.2.0
       ```
     - Verify installation: `ruby -v`

2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

#### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dddiscovery/datapoints.git
   cd datapoints
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
3. **Start Local Server**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

#### Common Issues
- **Permission Errors During Installation**
  - Try installing gems with the `--user-install` flag
  - Check directory permissions for your gem folder

- **Bundle Install Failures**
  - Run bundle update first
  - Clean and reinstall dependencies
  - Check for conflicting gem versions

- **Ruby Version Conflicts**
  - Ensure Ruby version matches requirements (3.2.0 recommended)
  - Use version managers (rbenv/RVM) to switch Ruby versions
  - Check Jekyll compatibility with your Ruby version

- **Port Already in Use**
  - Check for other running Jekyll instances
  - Try different port number
  - Restart your terminal

- **Missing Dependencies**
  - Install required system libraries
  - Check Gemfile for missing entries
  - Verify development headers are installed

#### Preview Across Devices (Using ngrok)

ngrok allows you to access your local development site from any device, regardless of network.


1. **Start Jekyll Server with Host Settings**
   ```bash
   cd datapoints    # Navigate to your project directory
   bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --baseurl=""
   ```
   Keep this terminal window open!
2. **Start ngrok in New Terminal**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 4000
   ```
   Keep this terminal window open too!
3. **Get the Public URL**
   - Look for the 'Forwarding' line in ngrok output
   - Use the `https://` URL (example: `https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`)
4. **Access on Other Devices**
   - Open the ngrok URL on any device
   - Site will be accessible regardless of network
   - Great for testing responsive design
   - Share URL with collaborators for quick previews

#### Notes
- ngrok URLs are temporary and change each session
- Free tier has some limitations
- For security, only share URLs with trusted collaborators

### GitHub Pages Deployment

#### Build Process

After completing all content and styling, pushing changes to the `main` branch triggers an automated build process.

1. **GitHub Action**
   - A GitHub Action called "Deploy Jekyll Site" is triggered
   - You can monitor the build at: https://github.com/dddiscovery/datapoints/actions
2. **Build Time**
   - The build process takes a few minutes to complete
   - You can track progress in the Actions tab
   - A green checkmark ‚úÖ indicates successful deployment
3. **Deployment**
   - The built site is automatically pushed to the `gh-pages` branch
   - Once deployed, your changes will be live at: https://dddiscovery.github.io/datapoints

#### Troubleshooting

- If the build fails (red ‚ùå), check the Actions tab for error details
- Common issues include:
  - Invalid front matter in posts
  - Missing required files
  - Incorrect file paths
  - Build timeout or resource limits exceeded
  - CSS or JavaScript not loading properly

#### Important Notes

- Only changes pushed to `main` trigger the build process
- The build configuration lives in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Wait for the green checkmark before checking your changes on the live site

### Ready, Set, Blog!

1. **Create a new branch for your post**
   - Branch naming convention: `post/YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName`
   - Example: `post/2025-01-27-Yuxin-Liang`

2. **Create your blog post in `_posts/` following the naming convention**
   - Create a new .md file named `YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName.md`
   - Use the template in `2025-01-22-post-temp.md` as a starting point
   - Write your blog content in Markdown format

3. **Create a matching directory in `assets/post_assets/` for your specific assets**
   - Directory should match your .md filename: `assets/post_assets/YYYY-MM-DD-FirstName-LastName/`
   - Place all post-specific content (images, CSS, scripts) in this directory

4. **Work on your staging branch**
   - Make all changes and test locally (follow the local development setup below)
   - Commit your changes regularly with descriptive messages

5. **Review and publish**
   - Request a review when your post is ready
   - After approval, merge your branch into main
